‚ùì FAQ - Integrated Assignment Environment

1. General Questions

Q: How do I start a new project?
A: Click "Create Project" on the main screen, fill in the required fields (e.g., student directory, compiler path), and save the configuration.

Q: Can I edit a saved configuration?
A: Yes. Load the configuration from the dropdown, modify the fields, and click "Save Configuration" again.

2. Configuration Issues

Q: The application says "Invalid compiler path." What should I do?
A: Ensure the path points to the correct executable (e.g., javac.exe for Java, python.exe for Python).
Use absolute paths (e.g., C:/Program Files/Java/jdk-21/bin/javac.exe).

Q: Why can‚Äôt the application find student submissions?
A: Verify the Student Directory path contains the files.
Ensure files are directly in the folder (no subfolders unless your app supports recursion).

3. Execution Problems

Q: My code compiles but doesn‚Äôt run. What‚Äôs wrong?
A: Check the Run Command field (e.g., java Main for Java, python script.py for Python).
Ensure the compiler and runtime environments are installed.

Q: The output is empty. How to debug?
A: Test the Run Command manually in your terminal/CMD.
Add print/log statements to student code to trace execution.

4. Results & Grading

Q: How are results compared to expected outputs?
A: The system performs a text-based comparison.
Ensure: expected outputs are in the specified directory.
Files are named identically to student submissions (e.g., output1.txt for student1.py).

Q: Can I export results?
A: Currently, results are displayed in-app. For exports, copy the table manually or check for future updates.

5. Troubleshooting

Q: The application crashes on startup.
A: Reinstall JavaFX/JRE.
Check if resources/ files (e.g., FXML) are in the correct location.

6. Advanced Features

Q: Can I add custom grading rules?
A: Not in this version. Future updates may support plugins or scripts.

Q: How to handle multiple languages (e.g., Java + Python)?
A: Save separate configurations for each language and switch between them.

üìå Notes
